# Transforming_data_into_database
# Course-Based Skills in Transforming Data to Database
This repository also reflects concepts and techniques learned in my "Transforming Data to Database" course. By the end of this course, I developed the following skills:

* SQL Server Administration: Configured SQL Server engine settings, managed data files, and ensured optimal database performance.
* Data Types and Classification: Explained capabilities of various data types, including classifications, common attributes, and default settings.
* Data Gathering and Transfer: Imported and exported data from multiple sources using built-in and custom SQL functions.
* Schema Design and Normalization: Built schemas following the normalization process, incorporating relationships, keys, and indexes for efficient database structure.
* Advanced Querying and Reporting: Queried the database across its entire business logic and aggregated data for robust reporting solutions.
* NoSQL Integration: Merged relational databases with NoSQL formats and converted specific data segments into a NoSQL structure for flexibility.
* Full-Text Search Indexing: Generated full-text search indexes to enhance data retrieval and search functionality.
* Data Modification Across Tables: Modified data within related tables, leveraging relationships to ensure data integrity.
* NoSQL Proficiency: Practiced NoSQL commands in MongoDB, identifying similarities and differences with SQL syntax and logic.

# Projects
# Salon Business Database Project
* The first project in this repository is a database for a salon business, created in DBeaver. This project includes:

  * Database Design: Structured tables to represent the business data, including clients, appointments, services, and employee details.
  * SQL Commands: Scripts with various SQL commands, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, to manage and retrieve data.
  * Business Insights: Queries designed to analyze customer trends, track appointment details, and manage service offerings.
 

# Boxstore Database Project
In this project, I designed and implemented a relational database for a hypothetical "Boxstore" using DBeaver and draw.io. Key aspects of this project include:

  * Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Created an ERD in draw.io to model entities, attributes, and relationships within the database. The main focus was on the people table and other tables that relate to it.
  * Database Schema: Built and organized tables in the "Boxstore" database to match the ERD, ensuring normalization and optimal relational structure.
  * SQL Scripting: Developed SQL scripts to create each table and establish relationships, including foreign keys and constraints, within DBeaver.
This project demonstrates my understanding of database design principles, ER modeling, and SQL scripting for real-world database implementations.
