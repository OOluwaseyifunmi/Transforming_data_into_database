* Data Types and Classification: Explained capabilities of various data types, including classifications, common attributes, and default settings.
* Data Gathering and Transfer: Imported and exported data from multiple sources using built-in and custom SQL functions.
* Schema Design and Normalization: Built schemas following the normalization process, incorporating relationships, keys, and indexes for efficient database structure.
* Advanced Querying and Reporting: Queried the database across its entire business logic and aggregated data for robust reporting solutions.
* NoSQL Integration: Merged relational databases with NoSQL formats and converted specific data segments into a NoSQL structure for flexibility.
* Full-Text Search Indexing: Generated full-text search indexes to enhance data retrieval and search functionality.
* Data Modification Across Tables: Modified data within related tables, leveraging relationships to ensure data integrity.
* NoSQL Proficiency: Practiced NoSQL commands in MongoDB, identifying similarities and differences with SQL syntax and logic.
